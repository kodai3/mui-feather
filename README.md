# mui-feather

This package provides the [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) packaged as a set of React components.

## Installation

Install the package in your project directory with:

```sh
// with npm
npm install mui-feather

// with yarn
yarn add mui-feather
```

These components use the Material-UI SvgIcon component to render the SVG path for each icon, and so it has a peer-dependency of Material-UI.

If you are not already using Material-UI in your project, you can add it with:

```sh
// with npm
npm install @material-ui/core

// with yarn
yarn add @material-ui/core
```
